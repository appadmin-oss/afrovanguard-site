# HANDOFF — NGG × Afrovanguard program of work

Working memory for the next agent. This file is duplicated in both repos
(`nextgengen/docs/HANDOFF.md` and `afrovanguard-site/docs/HANDOFF.md`).

---

## 0. Intent (what the user asked for)

Verbatim scope, plus one mid-stream addition:

1. **Audit and index the NGG website.**
2. **Find a way to sync it with Afrovanguard.**
3. **All Afrovanguard changes go to the `vigilant` branch.**
4. **Add a default super admin** with access to all admins and managers — "I need
   to be able to login."
5. **Improve the admin and managers UI and logic.**
6. **Upgrade the Anchor Journal** (design comps were provided as a zip).
7. (Added later) **"Do the separate super admin for NGG"** — NGG needs its own
   super admin, distinct from Afrovanguard.

The user's email (the intended super-admin identity): `mamcareer@afrovanguard.org.ng`.

### Repos & branches — IMPORTANT
- **Afrovanguard** (`appadmin-oss/afrovanguard-site`): develop on
  **`claude/vigilant-knuth-kuhk7c`** — this is the "vigilant" branch the user
  meant. Do NOT use the audit-sync branch for Afrovanguard.
- **NGG** (`appadmin-oss/nextgengen`): develop on
  **`claude/ngg-afrovanguard-audit-sync-becs2k`**.
- **mam-academy**: in scope but untouched — nothing was required there.
- No PRs have been opened yet (user was asked; hasn't answered). Don't open PRs
  unless asked.

## 1. Status — DONE, verified, pushed

| # | Task | Where | Verified |
|---|------|-------|----------|
| 1 | NGG audit & index | `nextgengen/docs/NGG-AUDIT-INDEX.md` | n/a (doc) |
| 2 | Afrovanguard default super admin + login | `afrovanguard-site` (vigilant) | login → superadmin, wrong pw rejected, idempotent |
| 3 | Admin/manager UI + logic | AV Studio card + NGG lockout guards | guard unit-tested |
| 4 | Anchor Journal upgrade (phases 2–4) | `nextgengen/journal/*` | `node build.js` clean |
| 5 | NGG ↔ Afrovanguard sync | both repos | end-to-end over HTTP |
| 6 | Separate NGG super admin | `nextgengen` | login → super_admin, idempotent |

### Task 2 — Afrovanguard super admin (vigilant branch)
- `lib/SuperAdmin.php` — idempotent, fingerprint-guarded `ensure()` sets BOTH
  `admin_users(email→superadmin)` AND `lms_users(role=admin, active, verified,
  password)`. Config: `AV_SUPERADMIN_EMAIL` / `_NAME` / `_PASSWORD`.
- Hooked into `login/index.php` and `admin/api.php` (login/session actions only).
- `db/seed_admin.php` CLI prints/reveals credentials. `admin/api.php` action
  `superadmin_reveal` + `admins_list` extras. Studio UI: `admin/index.php`
  `#adSuperCard` + `admin/app.js` `renderSuperCard()`.
- `.env.example` documents the block.

### Task 6 — NGG super admin (audit-sync branch)
- `api/_lib/superadmin.php` — `ensure_super_admin()` creates/promotes a
  `members` row `role=super_admin` with a password; config `super_admin`
  {email,name,password} in `api/config.php`.
- Hooked into `api/auth/{login,request,verify}.php`. CLI `api/tools/seed-admin.php`.
- NGG admins still pass a one-time TOTP setup on first Control Room visit (by
  design — do not weaken).

### Task 3 — admin logic
- AV: `admin/app.js` shows the default super admin + one-time password reveal.
- NGG: `api/_lib/domain/admin.php` `admin_members_upsert()` now blocks demoting/
  suspending the **last** active super_admin and **self**-demotion/suspension
  (`last_super_admin`, `cannot_demote_self`, `cannot_suspend_self`).

### Task 5 — sync (NGG mirrors Afrovanguard's approved mentor pool)
- **AV side:** `integrations/api.php` action `mentors.directory` + new
  `mentors:read` scope in `lib/AppTokens.php`.
- **NGG side:** `api/tools/sync-afrovanguard.php` (CLI/cron) upserts into
  `mentors` (`source='afrovanguard'`, keyed on `ref`); config `afrovanguard`
  {api_base, api_token}. Docs: `nextgengen/docs/afrovanguard-sync.md`.

### Task 4 — Anchor Journal (all in `nextgengen/journal/app.jsx` + `app.css`)
- Reflect editor v2 (School/Home/Peer structured logs + Coach entry card).
- Coach chat screen (`Coach`) → `NGGApi.member.coach`.
- Focus tool (`Focus`) + 4-tab nav (Journey·Focus·Growth·You).
- Notepad (`Notepad`) + Goals (`Goals`) + Quick Tools grid on Home.
- New `member_state` keys loaded on boot: `focusTasks:<day>`, `notes`, `goals`.

## 2. How to log in (tell the user)

**Afrovanguard:** email `mamcareer@afrovanguard.org.ng`. Set
`AV_SUPERADMIN_PASSWORD` in env for a known password, OR run
`php db/seed_admin.php` on the server to reveal an auto-generated one. Sign in at
`/login`. If Google sign-in is configured, "Continue with Google" (org account)
also lands as superadmin. Break-glass `AV_ADMIN_TOKEN` at `/admin` always works.

**NGG:** set `super_admin.password` in `api/config.php` (or run
`php api/tools/seed-admin.php` to reveal a generated one), then sign in with the
email + password and complete the authenticator (TOTP) setup on first Control
Room visit.

## 3. Anchor Journal — ALL PHASES DELIVERED (this session)

Everything below is pushed to `claude/ngg-afrovanguard-audit-sync-becs2k`,
each increment verified with `node build.js` (+ `php api/tests/run.php`,
148/148, where the backend changed). Details in
`docs/anchor-journal-v2-gap-analysis.md` §G.

1. ✅ **Multi-step onboarding (Phase 1).** Welcome → Name → Why → Study time;
   persists to `member_state.prefs` (+ `onboardedAt` — completion follows the
   account); Replay intro re-enters pre-filled (one-shot session flag).
2. ✅ **Shop + economy (Phase 5) + XP reconciliation.** Client adopts the
   server's flat model (60 XP/reflection-day, 250/level — `momentum.php` was
   already canonical). `member_state.shop`: diamonds (5/day + 5/focus-session
   − spend), Streak Freeze (30💎, max 2, auto-consume, sync-gated), accent
   themes (20💎) swapping `--a/--a-ink/--a-rgb` app-wide, gold level-up
   overlay (per-device baseline in localStorage — no server-clobber race).
3. ✅ **You → Your Circle (Phases 6–7).** Real invite code + Copy/rotate,
   LINKED/PENDING from `circle_links`, per-link revoke, and circle remarks
   surfacing in Weekly Review ("From your circle").
4. ✅ **Portal cohort strip (Phase 8 remainder).** New `circle.cohort` op
   (device token list → read-only summaries + at-risk flags); /circle
   remembers pairings, chip-switches students, "+ Add", graceful fall-over
   on revocation. (The role→code→verify→consent→dashboard flow shipped in
   an earlier session.)
5. ✅ **Phase 9 core** — printable report was already live; remark→Review
   wiring landed with (3). ✅ **Phase 10** fonts (earlier session).
   ✅ "Sound & haptics" toggle (A10).

6. ✅ **Runtime smoke.** `tests/journal-smoke.js` (Playwright + Chromium +
   real PHP backend on a throwaway SQLite DB): OTP sign-in → onboarding →
   Journey → Shop → Growth → You (live circle code) → Focus → anchor a
   reflection. PASS, zero uncaught page errors. Setup in the file header.

Nothing from the Anchor design comps remains open.

## 3b. Platform build wave (post-blueprint) — DONE, verified, pushed

All on `claude/ngg-afrovanguard-audit-sync-becs2k`; suite now 182/182 +
browser E2E. UX blueprint (locked v2): https://claude.ai/code/artifact/6744d694-868b-4f14-b547-7c2edcc52aaf

| Piece | Where | Verified |
|---|---|---|
| Identity gateway (one door, staff invisible) + device sessions/revoke + lockout + Argon2id + headers | auth.gateway, api/member/security.php, session.php, migration 10 | tests + live HTTP + smoke |
| AI key profiles (coach/behaviour/analysis/moderation, Gemini+Groq, fallback chains) | api/_lib/ai.php | tests (offline resolution) |
| Integration bus (outbox→GChat/signed webhooks/Apps Script Sheets; retries+log) + SMS (Termii→Twilio) | api/_lib/bus.php, sms.php, admin/integrations.php, tools/dispatch-events.php, docs/integrations.md, migration 11 | tests (mocked HTTP) |
| Registration stack (versioned form builder, gate links, parent verify + consents ledger, QR bind on verify, reminders) | api/_lib/domain/registration.php, admin/registration.php, public/gate.php, public/verify.php, tools/registration-reminders.php, migration 12 | tests + browser E2E |
| Inbound attendance webhook + published spec | api/hooks/attendance.php, docs/attendance-webhook.md | tests |
| Behaviour monitor (AI classify + rules fallback, wellbeing flags → bus) | api/_lib/domain/behaviour.php, migration 13 | tests |
| Gate desk UI (/gate?g=…) + parent page (/verify?t=…) | page-other.jsx (GatePage, ParentVerifyPage), app.jsx routes | Playwright E2E 12/12 |
| Audit (M&E) role — read-only by construction | util.php admin_role_caps, audit tail | tests green |

## 3c. REMAINING UI (backends all exist — wire, don't invent)

1. **Member dashboard shell** (dark blue #16223E + gold #FFCE54 + Tilt from
   motion.jsx): tabs Home · Growth · Me; journal = launcher REDIRECT (never a
   tab); W10 first-run (member.security has hasPassword/sessions; setPassword
   exists); Me → Security = NGGApi.member.security/securityRevoke*.
2. **Admin Today screen** (mobile-first W7): stat tiles from
   admin.registrations.list (pendingCount), admin.behaviour.list (openFlags),
   admin.summer.attendance; "Needs you" rows; gate-link manager
   (admin.registration.gates/gateCreate/gateRevoke); integrations screen
   (admin.integrations.*, test-fire + log); behaviour screen (admin.behaviour.*).
3. **Form builder UI** (W5) — admin.registration.form/publishForm; builder is
   super_admin-gated server-side already.
4. **Audit/M&E workspace** (W8 §6) — audit tail op is open to the 'audit'
   role; KPIs derivable from admin.summer.attendance + behaviour trend;
   indicators/report-builder = new (small) ops.
5. **ID card render + QR scan-by-camera** — waiting on the user's ID design;
   QR decode needs a vendored lib (jsQR); tokens already bind at verification
   and check in via typed code today.
6. **Legal pages** (NDPR set, §blueprint) — static content page + footer links.
7. Desktop journal rail shell (W9) + ⌘K in journal.

Gotchas for the wave: new JSX pages were appended to page-other.jsx (no new
ORDER entry needed); /gate + /verify are chrome-less routes in app.jsx; the
verify POST is CSRF-exempt (token IS the proof); test with throwaway config —
NEVER commit api/config.php; camera Permissions-Policy is camera=(self) in
.htaccess now.

---

## 4. Advice / gotchas for the next agent

- **NGG build is in-browser Babel; prod build needs esbuild.** `node build.js`
  requires `npm install esbuild --no-save` first (not vendored). It transpiles
  BOTH targets (main SPA + journal PWA), validates the `ORDER` array against
  `index.html`, and fails on drift. ALWAYS run it after editing `.jsx` — it's the
  only compile check. It does NOT catch runtime React errors — for those run
  `tests/journal-smoke.js` (Playwright; setup in its header).
- **Never commit** `nextgengen/api/config.php`, `afrovanguard-site/config.php`,
  `dist/`, or `node_modules/` (all git-ignored). Tests used throwaway SQLite DBs
  under the scratchpad + temporary config files that were cleaned up.
- **Journal entry body is line-based.** The Reflect editor joins labelled lines
  (`School: …`, `Home: …`, `Peer: …`, `Did well by …`, etc.); `parseEntry()`
  (top of `journal/app.jsx`) is the inverse. Keep each field on ONE line (no
  internal `\n`) or the parser breaks. The v2 structured logs fold into these
  single lines on purpose.
- **`member_state` persistence:** `setState(key, value)` in the journal is
  optimistic + fire-and-forget to `NGGApi.member.stateSet`. To have a key survive
  a reload, add it to the `stateGet([...])` boot fetch (~line 242 of
  `journal/app.jsx`).
- **Afrovanguard org-email → Google** only fires when Google is actually
  configured (`av_require_google_for_org`, `login/auth.js` `isOrgEmail`). So the
  seeded password super admin works out of the box; when Google IS configured,
  use Google instead. Don't "fix" this — it's intended.
- **Both super admins are idempotent + fingerprint-guarded** — safe to re-run.
  Changing the configured password re-applies automatically (fingerprint keyed
  on email|password). A blank password generates one, stored once for a single
  reveal (CLI `--reveal` or Studio button), then cleared.
- **Afrovanguard is a mature, well-built PHP app** ("the Studio"): superadmin >
  admin > editor (`admin_users`), member RBAC via `LmsAuth`
  (learner<member<mentor<coordinator<admin), OTP/password/Google sign-in,
  mentorship engine, webhooks, inbound integrations API + App Tokens. Reuse this
  infra rather than building parallel systems (the sync did — extend the same
  pattern for any new cross-site flow: scoped App Token in, webhook/cron out).
- **Verification commands** (throwaway DB; clean up after):
  - AV: `AV_DB_PATH=/tmp/…/x.sqlite php db/seed_admin.php`
  - NGG: create a temp `api/config.php` (sqlite_path → scratch), then
    `php api/tools/seed-admin.php`; delete config.php after.
  - Sync e2e: serve AV via `php -S 127.0.0.1:8199 -t afrovanguard-site` with
    `AV_DB_PATH` set + a seeded approved mentor + `mentors:read` token, point
    NGG's `afrovanguard.api_token` at it, run `sync-afrovanguard.php --dry-run`.
- **Commit trailers**: a `Claude-Session:` line only. Do NOT add a
  `Co-Authored-By` line, a model identifier, or any external email to
  commits or PRs.
- **Don't touch mam-academy** unless asked.
